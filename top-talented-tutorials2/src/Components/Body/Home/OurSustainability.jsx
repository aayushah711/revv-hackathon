                <h1>Measure, Reduce, Offset</h1>
                <p>We have a plan to eliminate our products’ carbon footprint, and it’s already in action. First, we measure the emissions of everything from their raw materials to their end of life. Next, we reduce our impact by incorporating things like natural and recycled materials. And finally, we offset the little bit that’s left with carbon offsets, making Allbirds a completely carbon neutral business. But our goal is bigger—emit no carbon in the first place. We can create a sustainable future, but only if we hold each other accountable.</p>

                    <h2>What’s In A Footprint?</h2>
                    <p>Well, our carbon footprint is the kg CO2e emitted to create our products. That stands for kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. And it means we’re tallying all greenhouse gases and converting them to CO2 when measuring the environmental impact of all our products from now on. So when we say the average footprint of our products is 7.6 kg CO2e (reminder: that means “carbon dioxide equivalent emissions”—a mouthful, we know), we’re saying we’re keeping tabs on things like methane emissions, too, a greenhouse gas even more potent than carbon dioxide.</p>

                    <h2>Measure</h2>
                    <p>We start with the materials we source, replacing synthetics with natural, renewable materials whenever we can. We keep track of energy used throughout our manufacturing, too. We also factor in use—since our products are machine washable, the energy from the washing machine comes into the equation. Finally, there’s end of life—we don’t have a great solution in place to lay your Allbirds to rest yet, but we’re working on it.</p>
                    <p>We report transportation separately in our company-wide emissions—you can read more about the nitty gritty here.</p>

                    <h2>Our Carbon Footprint</h2>
                    <p>The result of those measurements? Our products’ Carbon Footprint. The total amount of CO2e (remember what that stands for? hint: it’s “carbon dioxide equivalent emissions”) emitted to create each Allbirds product, before we offset that number to zero. We’re putting our numbers on display for the world to see, just like nutrition labels on food. Because knowing our footprint is the first step towards driving it to zero.</p>

So until we reach our goal of zero, we’re taxing ourselves for the carbon we do emit, and investing in offsets to fund projects that neutralize our footprint. </p>
